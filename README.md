# SayAI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Project Title
**SayAI RAG: A Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

This project is designed to enhance data-driven workflows by combining efficient retrieval systems with generative AI capabilities. The goal is to enable fast, relevant, and context-aware responses by integrating a vector database with custom text processing and query handling pipelines.

---

## Project Description

SayAI RAG is a Python-based project that combines retrieval systems with generative workflows to enhance data accessibility and usability. By integrating Milvus as a vector store, efficient text search, and text chunking, this framework supports advanced information retrieval for real-world applications.

### Why This Project?

1. **Real-World Problem**: Existing systems often fail to provide both context and relevance in generated responses. This project addresses that by combining retrieval and generation.
2. **Technology Stack**:
   - **Milvus**: Enables high-performance vector search.
   - **Python**: Powers the logic and integration of components.
   - **SQLite**: Provides lightweight, local storage.

### Challenges and Future Enhancements
- **Challenges**:
  - Handling large datasets efficiently in real-time.
  - Ensuring seamless integration between retrieval and generation.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Add support for cloud-based vector stores.
  - Implement fine-tuned models for specific domains.
  - Provide a web interface for easier accessibility.
